# AI Plant Disease Detection Backend â€” Development & Deployment Plan

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Set up a clean Python virtual environment.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install Django, Django REST Framework, ONNX Runtime, Pillow, and Simple JWT.

3. **Start Django Project**  
   Initialize a new Django project and create an app (e.g., `detection`).

---

## Phase 2: Basic Configuration

4. **Configure Installed Apps**  
   Add `'rest_framework'`, `'detection'`, and JWT/auth-related apps to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

5. **Set Up Media Handling**  
   Configure `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in settings for image uploads.

6. **Connect to Database**  
   Use SQLite (dev) or Postgres (prod), then run initial migrations.

---

## Phase 3: AI Model Integration

7. **Add Your ONNX Model**  
   Place the `.onnx` model file inside the project directory.

8. **Write Prediction Logic**  
   Implement utility functions to:
   - Load ONNX model  
   - Preprocess input images  
   - Run inference  
   - Return predicted class and confidence score

---

## Phase 4: Build the API

9. **Create API Endpoint for Prediction**  
   Accept image(s) in POST requests and return prediction results including confidence scores.  
   Support both single and batch predictions.

---

## Phase 5: User Authentication

10. **Add JWT Authentication**  
    Implement user registration and login endpoints using JWT.

11. **Secure Prediction API**  
    Require users to authenticate to access prediction endpoints.

---

## Phase 6: Prediction History

12. **Create Prediction History Model**  
    Define model fields for user, image, predicted class, confidence score, and timestamp.

13. **Log Predictions**  
    Save each prediction made by a user in the database.

14. **Add Serializer and API Endpoint**  
    Allow users to fetch their prediction history.

---

## Phase 7: Batch Predictions

15. **Enable Batch Prediction Support**  
    Modify API to accept multiple images per request and return corresponding results.

---

## Phase 8: Testing

16. **Manual API Testing**  
    Test registration, login, prediction (single & batch), and history retrieval via Postman or cURL.

17. **Write Automated Tests (Optional)**  
    Create unit and integration tests for API endpoints and prediction logic.

---

## Phase 9: Deployment

18. **Prepare for Production**  
    Set environment variables, disable DEBUG, and configure allowed hosts.

19. **Setup Cloud Storage for Media (Optional)**  
    Use services like AWS S3 or Cloudinary for user-uploaded images.

20. **Deploy on Hosting Platform**  
    Choose a platform (Render, Railway, Heroku with Docker, DigitalOcean) and deploy.

21. **Configure Static & Media Files in Production**  
    Use WhiteNoise or cloud storage to serve static and media files.

---

## Phase 10: Finalization

22. **Generate API Documentation (Optional)**  
    Use Swagger/OpenAPI with `drf-spectacular` or `drf-yasg`.

23. **Secure the API**  
    Implement file upload size limits, rate limiting, and input validation.

24. **Integrate with Mobile App**  
    Connect and test the backend with your mobile frontend app.
